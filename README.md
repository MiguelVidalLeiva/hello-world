# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow. 

A bit about myself includes that I like to:
  -Go surfing around huricanes and winter swells.
  -Play music, I can play guitar and currently learning to play the piano and drums. Drums is my new favorite instrument, althought it annoys some people. 

  -I am a returning student to FAU. At first I went for Computer Science, but switched between that, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. I'm passionate about all of that. 
  -During my time away from school, I learned how to prospect for business, whether it was a painting business, or as a Real Estate Agent. It gave me plenty of people, communication, presentation, and sales/marketing skills. I believe those are important in our industry in addition to the skills that are needed. I hope to be of great use to any organization willing to hire me or even the government if I decide to join the military afteror prior to graduating.
